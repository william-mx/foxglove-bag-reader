# Foxglove Bagfile Reader for Colab

This is a lightweight Python utility for working with **ROS bagfiles stored on Foxglove Data Platform**.  
It allows you to connect with your Foxglove account, browse recordings, parse topics into pandas DataFrames,  
extract images, export them for further analysis, and also access **events** from your recordings â€” all directly in Google Colab or Jupyter.

### Quickstart

See the provided Jupyter notebook for a complete demo.  
In general, the workflow looks like this:

1. **Install the package**
 ```python
%%capture
!pip install git+https://github.com/william-mx/foxglove-bag-reader.git
```

2. **Connect with your Foxglove API key**

 ```python
 from google.colab import userdata
 API_KEY = userdata.get("FOXGLOVE_KEY")  # store your key in Colab userdata

 from foxglove_bag_reader import BagfileReader
 r = BagfileReader(API_KEY)
 ```

3. **List available recordings**

 ```python
 r.print_recordings()
 ```

4. **Example: work with images**

 ```python
 # Get images from a camera topic
 images = r.get_all_images('/camera/color/image_jpeg')

 # Export them to a directory
 export_dir = project_dir / 'export'
 r.export_images('/camera/color/image_jpeg', export_dir)
 ```

5. **Example: work with events**

 ```python
 # Retrieve events from the bagfile
 events = r.get_events()
 print(events[:3])  # show first 3 events
   ```

Each event contains:

* `metadata`: event description
* `start`: event start timestamp (ns)
* `end`: event end timestamp (ns)
